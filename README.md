# $WAGMIK – We're All Gonna Make It... Kinda

Welcome to the official GitHub repo for **$WAGMIK**, the most emotionally unstable meme coin on Solana.

## 🧬 The Lore

Born in the shadow of Bonk's moonshot, $WAGMIK is Bonk's forgotten cousin—left behind in the trenches of Crypto Twitter. 
He didn’t just miss the pump… he *was the liquidity*.

One day, fed up with his $27 in his wallet and 12 browser tabs open to CoinGecko, WAGMIK asked the AI:

> *“Yo, what do I do now?”*

And the AI whispered:

> **“Launch. Meme. Hope.”**

Now he’s here. Poorly drawn. Emotionally volatile. But vibing harder than ever.
